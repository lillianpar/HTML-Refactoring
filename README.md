# Homework-1
First Repository, Code Refactor
In this Homework, I have reviewed sematic code. I first used sematic code in High School and then the prework.
In this assignment I have learned how to consolidate text to limit the amount of lines being used. I tried to
clean up the code as best I can, in CSS and Index.html. In this assignment we focused perdominitely on the 
different between <section> and <div>. I also added a fooder and main tag where it was needed, with some
assistance from a turor. This homework was a little difficult because I didnt know there to begin at first,
but with a little bit of guidence and some extra Google-Fu, I think I nailed a few of the corrections. I am 
still a little unsure if I have managed to find all of the errors. I also tried my best to make notes in the 
code where needed, but I feel as if I might have repeated myself too much in some instances. For this homework,
I feel like I have a better understannding of the sequential order that the tags are supposed to be layed out
in. This project was mainly to see how text is set up and how to correct errors in a fully working webpage.
During this project, I have gained a better understanding for Git Push and the importance of doing it often.
The project has widened my understanding for Terminal and the importance that it holds for being able to
share code and ideas.

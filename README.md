# Homework-1
First Repository, Code Refactor

The objective for this assignment was to refactor code in a working website, to make it more accessible. 
One of the main points was to clean up the code and consolidate the lines that were repetitive.
In this poccess, side notes were also created to help the viewer understand what was changed. Another objective 
was to change some of the <div> tags and replace them with <section> tags, following sematic organization. There 
was also missing "alt" tags as well as <footer> tags. The sematic layout helps differentiate where a image would be placed and to break up sections. It was also important that the code fell in sequential order, so that it could 
be easier to read.
